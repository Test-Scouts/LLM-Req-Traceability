The task was to develop a product that would help people with disabilities to open plastic bags. The product should be able to open the plastic bags with one hand and should not be too heavy to use. The product should also be able to be used in different types of supermarkets.The project followed the design process which started with a research phase. The research phase included interviews and a study of existing products. The information from the research phase was used to develop a requirement specification. The requirement specification was used to develop a concept. The concept was evaluated and developed until a final concept was chosen. The final concept was developed further and a prototype was made. The prototype was evaluated and adjusted until the group was satisfied.The result was a foldable bag that opens with a push button in the front. The bag can be used as a handheld device or placed on the ground. The bag has a compartment for gloves and a compartment for the user to place their belongings. The user can also place the bag on their shoulder. The push button is covered by a finger flap. The push button is used to open the bag and the finger flap is used to protect the user from getting hurt by the button. The bag can be used for different types of supermarkets and has a design that makes it easy to use. The project resulted in a product that opens the plastic bags with one hand and that is easy to use.,"The client should (S247), with the help of an independent party, be able to conduct penetration tests, or equivalent audits, on the measurement system.",S247
759,B113 - Synchronization with GE controlled NTP,The measurement system and the surrounding infrastructure that is within GE's network should (B113) be synchronized with GE controlled NTP.,B113
